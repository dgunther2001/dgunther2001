### Hi, my name is Daniel Gunther!

I'm a computer scientist and geologist passionate about understanding not just what my computer can do, but how it does what it does. Although I have many projects circulating on my GitHub, I highly suggest looking at the following first, as I aim for these to be my showcase pieces:

---

- #### ðŸŒŸ **[Pyroxene](https://github.com/dgunther2001/pyroxene_lang):** ðŸŒŸ
##### &emsp; Planned Core Features:
- **Graph-Centric:** First-class support for graphs with built-in algorithms like BFS, and DFS.
- **LLVM Integration:** Direct compilation to LLVM IR, with plans to extend to ARM assembly.
- **Customizable and Modular:** Flexibility to modify and overwrite built-in graph algorithms and representations.

#### &emsp; Currently Implemented:
- **Lexer:** Tokenizer of custom syntax.
- **Parser/AST:** Tree-like parsing a representation of Pyroxene's grammar.
- **LLVM IR:** Generation of global variables.

##### &emsp; Roadmap:
- IR generation for the rest of Pyroxene's grammar.
- ARM assembly pipeline integration.
- Comprehensive standard library development.

&emsp; This project is the **cornerstone of my portfolio** and illustrates my **intellectual curiosity** and **acumen with low level systems.**

- #### [Boot Simulation](https://github.com/dgunther2001/BIOS_Hardware_Simulation):
  I've also always been interested in the computer boot process, the "here be dragons" territory where circuits of hardware components and electrical signals are somehow orchestrated together to create the environment I am writing this file in. As a secondary project, I have started to build a simulator in C++ that starts with logic gates and latches, which will go through and execute a simulated boot process with minimal abstraction.

### Relevant Skills:

- **Programming Languages:** C, C++, Assembly, Rust, Java, Python
- **Technologies:** LLVM, Compiler Development, Git, Docker, CI/CD
