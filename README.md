### Hi, my name is Daniel Gunther!

I'm a computer scientist and geologist passionate about understanding not just what my computer can do, but how it does what it does. Although I have many projects circulating on my GitHub, I highly suggest looking at the following first, as I aim for these to be my showcase pieces:

- **[Pyroxene](https://github.com/dgunther2001/pyroxene_lang):**  
  To understand how programming languages work, I've taken a deep dive with my latest project into the LLVM, developing my own graph-based programming language, which I hope to eventually build a pipeline through LLVM directly to ARM assembly.

- **[Boot Simulation](https://github.com/dgunther2001/BIOS_Hardware_Simulation):**  
  I've also always been interested in the computer boot process, the "here be dragons" territory where circuits of hardware components and electrical signals are somehow orchestrated together to create the environment I am writing this file in. As a secondary project, I have started to build a simulator in C++ that starts with logic gates and latches, which will go through and execute a simulated boot process with minimal abstraction.

### Relevant Skills:

- **Programming Languages:** C, C++, Assembly, Rust, Java, Python
- **Technologies:** LLVM, Compiler Development, Git, Docker, CI/CD
