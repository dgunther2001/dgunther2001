Hi, my name is Daniel Gunther!<br />

I'm a computer scientist and geologist passionate about understanding not just what my computer can do, but how it does what it does. <br />
Although I have many projects circulating on my github, I highly suggest looking at the following first, as I aim for these to be my showcase pieces. <br />
&emsp; => To understand how programming languages work, I've taken a deep dive with my latest project into the LLVM, developing my own graph based <br />
&emsp; &emsp; programming language which I hope to eventually build a pipeline through LLVM directly to ARM assembly <br />
&emsp; &emsp; **[Pyroxene](https://github.com/dgunther2001/pyroxene_lang)**: Pyroxene Lang <br />
&emsp; => I've also alwways been interested in the computer boot process, the "here be dragons" territory where circuits of hardware components and electrical <br />
&emsp; &emsp; signals are somehow orchestrated together to create the environment I am writing this file in. As a secondary project, I have started to build <br />
&emsp; &emsp; a simulator in c++ that starts with logic gates and latches, that will go through and execute a simulated boot process with minimal abstraction. <br />
&emsp; &emsp; **[Hardware Simulation](https://github.com/dgunther2001/BIOS_Hardware_Simulation)**: BIOS and POST simulator <br />

Relevant Skills: <br />
=> C, C++, Assembly <br />
=> Rust, Java, Python <br />
=> LLVM, Compiler Development <br />
=> Git, Docker, CI/CD <br />
