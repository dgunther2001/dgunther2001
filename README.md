### Hi, my name is Daniel Gunther!

I'm a computer scientist and geologist passionate about understanding not just what my computer can do, but how it does what it does. Although I have many projects circulating on my GitHub, I highly suggest looking at **Pyroxene**, as I aim for it to be my showcase piece.

---

#### ðŸŒŸ **[Pyroxene](https://github.com/dgunther2001/pyroxene_lang):** ðŸŒŸ
##### &emsp; Planned Core Features:
- **Graph-Centric:** Support for graphs with built-in algorithms like BFS, and DFS.
- **LLVM Integration:** Direct compilation to LLVM IR, with plans to extend to ARM assembly.
- **Customizable and Modular:** Flexibility to modify and overwrite built-in graph algorithms and representations.

##### &emsp; Currently Implemented:
- **Lexer:** Tokenizer of custom syntax.
- **Parser/AST:** Token parsing into an Abstract Syntax Tree that represents Pyroxene's grammar.
- **LLVM IR:** Generation of variables (declarations and definitions), as well as function declarations.

##### &emsp; Roadmap:
- IR generation for the rest of Pyroxene's grammar.
- ARM assembly pipeline integration.
- Comprehensive standard library development.

&emsp; This project is the **cornerstone of my portfolio** and illustrates my **intellectual curiosity** and **acumen with low level systems.**
